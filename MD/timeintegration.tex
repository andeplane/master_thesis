\section{Time integration}
The idea of doing a Molecular Dynamics simulation is to start from some initial state $(\vec r_0, \vec v_0)$ and compute the time evolution of atoms following Newton's equations through the defined forces. We will use this time evolution to sample statistics from states in the phase space, assuming that the time evolution will guide the system through the phase space with probabilities according to the statistical ensemble. A standard Molecular Dynamics simulation, we want to sample states from the microcanonical ensemble (NVE) where the energy, volume and number of atoms are conserved. Our choice of time integrator should therefore conserve energy as good as possible.\\

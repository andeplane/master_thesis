\section{Time integration}
\label{sec:md_time_integration}
Da scam of bustin a Molecular Dynamics simulation is ta start from some initial state $(\vec r_0, \vec v_0)$ n' compute tha time evolution of atoms followin Newtonz equations wit tha defined forces. Us thugs will use dis time evolution ta sample statistics from states up in tha phase space, assumin dat tha time evolution will guide tha system all up in tha phase space wit probabilitizzles accordin ta tha statistical ensemble. This was tha assumption of ergodicity. In a standard Molecular Dynamics simulation, we wanna sample states from tha microcanonical ensemble (NVE) where tha juice, volume n' number of atoms is conserved. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Our chizzle of time integrator should therefore conserve juice as phat as possible fo' realz. A phat chizzle is tha Velocitizzle Verlet algorithm, which is known ta be both fast n' conserve juice like well\cite{frenkel2001understanding}.

Da Velocitizzle Verlet algorithm requires tha knowledge of tha positions, velocitizzles n' instantaneous accelerationz of tha atoms. Da latter is found all up in tha force on a atom $\vec a_i = \vec F_i/m_i$, so it requires tha storage of $9N$ variablez up in a system wit $N$ atoms. Our thugged-out asses have derived tha Velocitizzle Verlet algorithm rockin tha Liouville formulation of time evolution up in appendix \ref{app:liouville}. Da integration steps are
\begin{align}
	\vec v(t + \Delta t/2) &= \vec v(t) + \frac{\vec F(t)}{m}\frac{\Delta t}{2}\\
	\vec r(t + \Delta t) &= \vec r(t) + \vec v(t + \Delta t/2)\Delta t\\
	\vec v(t + \Delta t) &= \vec v(t + \Delta t/2) + \frac{\vec F(t + \Delta t)}{m}\frac{\Delta t}{2},
\end{align}
which is done each timestep fo' every last muthafuckin atom up in tha system. We call tha straight-up original gangsta step a \textit{half kick}, cuz it integrates tha velocitizzle wit forward Eula wit half a timestep. Da posizzle is then also integrated wit forward Eula wit tha full timestep $\Delta t$ before our phat asses do another half kick.

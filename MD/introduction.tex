Molecular Dynamics be another numerical model dat raps bout tha behavior of liquids, gases n' solidz all up in tha finest scale of any old-ass model. We can study tha dynamics of single atoms n' how tha fuck they interact wit each other formin moleculez n' larger objects like advanced pore networks. Da scam is simple n' has been used since tha time of Sir Isaac Newton up in tha 17th century when he formulated his fuckin lawz of motion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. With tha knowledge of tha relevant forces between tha atoms, we can solve Newtonz equations n' calculate they dynamics.

We open dis chapter by a short introduction ta tha model up in section \ref{sec:md_model} before we explain how tha fuck forces is calculated wit tha Lennard-Jones potential up in section \ref{sec:md_forces}. With computed forces, we can integrate tha atoms wit Newtonz laws followin a time integration scheme which our phat asses say shit bout up in section \ref{sec:md_time_integration}. Da last section is concerned wit how tha fuck we keep a cold-ass lil constant temperature rockin a thermostat. Physical quantitizzles is measured up in tha same way as our phat asses did up in DSMC up in section \ref{sec:dsmc_measuring_physical_quantities}.

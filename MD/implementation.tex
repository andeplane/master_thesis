In this chapter we will go through the implementation of the MD code in the same way we did with DSMC in chapter \ref{chap:dsmc_implementation}. We discuss the stages from the beginning of the simulation and introduce implementation techniques when they appear in the process. Assume that we want to simulate $N$ atoms in a box of physical size $L_x \times L_y \times L_z$. Our choice of units is described in appendix \ref{app:physical_units}. We start with section \ref{sec:md_parallelization} by briefly explaining how the code is parallelized, since this affects many of the implementation choices we have made.

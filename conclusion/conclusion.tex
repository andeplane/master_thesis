\section{Summary}
After havin explained n' discussed all models n' tha thangs up in dis biatch our crazy asses have obtained durin our work, it is convenient ta briefly summarize tha thesis. Da main physical problem our phat asses discussed up in tha beginnin was shale gas extraction. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. In tha fracturin process, tha gas is busted out from within tha shalez all up in lil' small-ass pore networks, lil' small-ass channels wit diameter from all dem nanometas n' up. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Standard hydrodynamics breaks down at dis scale cuz slip velocitizzle n' non-continuum effects, so we needed a model enablin our asses ta study gas dynamics at dis scale. In chapter \ref{chap:kinetic_theory} we briefly discussed statistical mechanics n' kinetic theory, n' used dis ta derive tha Boltzmann equation, tha mean free path n' tha mean collision time. These thangs up in dis biatch was used ta justify tha DSMC model up in chapter \ref{chap:dsmc}. We explained how tha fuck tha model is implemented up in chapter \ref{chap:dsmc_implementation}. With tha parallel implementation n' tha voxel-based representation of arbitrary geometries, we managed ta big up tha straight-up original gangsta two goals $a)$ n' $b)$ up in section \ref{sec:goals}.

In chapter \ref{chap:dsmc_results}, our phat asses discussed tha simulations wit both model validation, performizzle tests n' permeabilitizzle analysis. Da implementation shows a promisin scalin performizzle up ta at least 512 processors up in addizzle ta computin erect velocitizzle profilez fo' a big-ass range of Knudsen numbers compared ta work of others. We confirmed dat tha Knudsen erection from section \ref{sec:knudsen_correction} predicted tha permeabilitizzle straight-up well fo' cylinders, a geometry wit a well defined Knudsen number n' shit. In tha case of packed spheres, tha Knudsen number is less obvious how tha fuck ta define cuz of statistical spread up in tha geometrical formation of tha spheres, we found dat a expectation value of tha pore size could be used ta find what tha fuck we called a estimated Knudsen number (see appendix \ref{app:knudsen_number_packed_spheres}). Us thugs was able ta predict tha permeabilitizzle ta tha erect order of magnitude yo, but tha geometrical statistical spread was reflected all up in a spread up in tha final measured permeability. Da ratio between tha phattest n' tha smallest permeabilitizzles was a gangbangin' factor two or more.\\
We then moved on ta say shit bout tha second model our crazy asses have studied, Molecular Dynamics, wit a introduction ta tha model up in chapter \ref{chap:md}. Da numerical implementation was explained up in detail up in chapter \ref{chap:md_implementation}. We also introduced a freshly smoked up model fo' simulatin fluidz confined by a solid dat interacts wit realistic atomic forces n' remains bein a solid wit tha initial geometry by addin a harmonic oscillator potential on tha atoms. Da thangs up in dis biatch up in chapter \ref{chap:md_results} flossed dat tha parallel implementation scaled satisfactory up ta at least one thousand processors. We ran tha MD program ta measure tha permeabilitizzle up in a cold-ass lil cylinder fo' different Knudsen numbers, just like our phat asses did wit DSMC. By simulatin a similar system yo, but wit a model based on different physical fundamentals, dis be a phat way ta validate tha Knudsen erection fo' both different length scalez n' a big-ass range of Knudsen numbers. In MD, tha cylinder was 30 times smalla than up in DSMC (\unit{15}{\nano\meter} vs \unit{450}{\nano\meter}), wit thangs up in dis biatch confirmin dat tha Knudsen erection works straight-up well also fo' pores as lil' small-ass as 15 nanometers. Combinin tha thangs up in dis biatch from both models, tha goals $c)$ n' $f)$ was  bigged up . Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Us thugs will git back ta tha Knudsen erection up in tha rap section below. Us dudes did not manage ta implement tha water-silica potential up in MD as we wanted ta do up in goal $e)$. This would allow our asses ta use MD ta study flow up in mo' realistic systems than wit tha Lennard-Jones potential. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack. 
\\
In tha last part of tha thesis, tha custom 3D visualization tool, we first gave a introduction ta OpenGL n' its purpose up in chapter \ref{chap:opengl}. Us dudes discussed tha basics of graphics programmin as well as tha mo' advanced, blingin partz of tha renderin pipeline dat allowed our asses ta pimp a mad efficient visualization program ta visualize big-ass particle data sets wit tenz of millionz of atoms rendered real-time wit a thugged-out decent frame rate. This was possible by rockin a cold-ass lil combination of billboardz n' instanced geometry shaders, both explained up in chapter \ref{chap:particle_visualizer}. We concluded tha part wit a gangbangin' final show-off gallery up in section \ref{sec:vis_gallery}. With this, our crazy asses have  bigged up  tha last goal $d)$ from section \ref{sec:goals}.

My first encounter with physics was in high school with my physics teacher Knut L{\o}vseth. I remember your classes. They were filled with enthusiasm and joy - you showed how much you love physics and science. You are a true inspirer, a great motivator. I am grateful for how you showed me the path to what I love the most - physics.

Later on, at the university, when I attended lectures in the introductory course in mechanics, I met Professor Anders Malthe-S{\o}renssen, who later became my supervisor. I want to thank you for being another very inspiring person. Every time we talk I get motivated and hungry for learning more, exploring new ideas and connecting the dots in my life. I enjoy every discussion about physics, startups and choices in life in general. 

I would also like to thank Svenn-Arne Dragly, whom I have shared endless hours with, having fun learning OpenGL, programming, physics and useless things like stories about prisoners and chests. Our work together does not stop here, we will continue creating amazing stuff.

Learning about Molecular Dynamics and statistical mechanics has been a joyful ride thanks to Kjetil Th{\o}gersen, J{\o}rgen Kjoshagen Tr{\o}mborg and Camilla Kirkemo Alm. All our discussions about potentials, water, salt, no salt, erroneously salt and cage correlation functions have been great. Also, thank you for all your help with my thesis. I look forward to working with you over the next years.

And of course, a special thanks to Andreas Nakkerud. All the things we have done the past years have been great. Lastly, I want to thank Thea Marcelia Sletten. You are an amazing person.

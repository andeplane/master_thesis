\section{Vertex Buffer Objects}
\label{sec:opengl_vbo}
A Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) is a feature in OpenGL that allows the user to upload an array of vertices to the graphics card which can be used for fast rendering. This could for example be a set of positions, colors or normal vectors. Once this data is uploaded to the GPU, we can render the model described by the VBO in very few function calls. First, we ask the GPU to give us a buffer identifier (which is just an int) that we will use when we work with the VBO (uploading new data or using the data). Then we tell the GPU to allocate enough memory to store our vertices before we copy the data from the main memory to the graphics card.

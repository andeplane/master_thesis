\caption{A cube consisting of eight vertices. Given that each vertex can have a value smaller or larger than some given iso-value, the cube has has $2^8=256$ different combinations. This number can, as we see here, be reduced to 15 due to symmetries. An iso-surface on a scalar field can then be generated as renderable triangles with this technique.

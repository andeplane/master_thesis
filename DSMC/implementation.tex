In this chapter we will go into detail about how the DSMC model is implemented in \textit{c++}. We assume that the reader is familiar with c++ and object orientation. First, we discuss how the code is object oriented and how the different classes are structured. We will explain how particles are divided into collision cells and how the collisions are calculated. The algorithm for detecting and performing surface interactions is discussed, in addition to how the code is parallelized with Message Passing Interface (MPI). 
\section{Code structure and variables}
The main function of the program initiates an instance of the class \textit{System} which is the main class of the program. It contains pointers to

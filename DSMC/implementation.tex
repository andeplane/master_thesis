In this chapter we will go into detail about how the DSMC model is implemented. We will explain how particles are divided into collision cells and how the collisions are calculated. The algorithm for detecting and performing surface interactions is discussed, in addition to how the code is parallelized with Message Passing Interface (MPI).

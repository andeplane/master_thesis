In this chapter we will go into detail about how the DSMC model is implemented in \textit{c++}. First, we discuss how the code is object oriented and how the different classes are structured. We will explain how particles are divided into collision cells and how the collisions are calculated. The algorithm for detecting and performing surface interactions is discussed, in addition to how the code is parallelized with Message Passing Interface (MPI).

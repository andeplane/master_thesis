\subsection{Flow in a cylinder, varying Knudsen number}
We have induced flow in a voxelized cylinder as shown in figure \ref{fig:cylinder_flow}. The cylinder has radius $0.45 \mu m$ with an applied acceleration corresponding to a pressure difference $\Delta P = 1.1P_0$, where $P_0$ is the ideal gas pressure at $T=300K$. We can choose the Knudsen number through the density
\begin{align}
	\rho_n(\text{Kn}) = {1\over \sqrt 2 \pi d^2 \text{Kn}L},
\end{align}
where $L$ is the length of the cylinder.

\end{center}
\caption{Voxelized (128x128x128 voxels) cylinder with radius $0.45\mu m$.}
\end{figure}
We expect an apparent permeability following the Knudsen correction factor $f_c$ from section \ref{sec:knudsen_correction}
\begin{align}
	k_a = k_\infty f_c = k_\infty[1 + \alpha(\text{Kn})\text{Kn}]\left[1 + {4\text{Kn}\over 1 - b\text{Kn}}\right],
\end{align}
where $k_\infty$ is the high density limit permeability; the absolute permeability. The analytical absolute permeability for a cylinder is given by\cite{karniadakis2005microflows}
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:permeability_cylinder}
	k_\infty = {r^2\over 8},
\end{align}
which gives the following prediction for the apparent permeability
\begin{align}
	k_a = [1 + \alpha(\text{Kn})\text{Kn}]\left[1 + {4\text{Kn}\over 1 - b\text{Kn}}\right] {r^2\over 8}.
\end{align}
In figure \ref{fig:one_cylinder_varying_knudsen} we have plotted the measured permeability as a function of Knudsen number. We see that the permeability is slightly smaller than the analytical prediction as we would expect since the cylinder is voxelized.

The blue line is the Knudsen corrected analytical solution from \cite{karniadakis2005microflows}. The DSMC results show slightly higher permeability as we expect from the voxelation.}

\subsection{Flow in a cylinder, varying radius}
If we instead keep the Knudsen number constant ($\text{Kn}=1.0$), we can vary the radius to verify equation \eqref{eq:permeability_cylinder}. We have studied radii in the range $0.1 \mu m$ to $0.45 \mu m$ with the same pressure difference as in the previous subsection. In figure \ref{fig:one_cylinder_varying_radii_result} we have plotted the measured permeability as a function of cylinder radius. The straight line confirms the quadratic dependency in equation \eqref{eq:permeability_cylinder}.

\section{Results for complicated geometries}
\subsection{Randomly packed spheres}
Through the Carman-Kozeny equation, we can theoretically predict the permeability for randomly packed spheres 
\begin{align}
	k = {a^2 \over 9K} {\phi^3 \over (1 - \phi)^2},
\end{align}
where $\phi$ is the porosity, $a$ is the sphere radius and $K$ Kozeny constant which is experimentally measured to be around five\cite{carman1937fluid}. This theoretical result has been verified to predict permeabilities in experiments, but at micrometer scale, we expect deviations.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Flow in a cylinder}
We will induce flow in a voxelized cylinder as shown in figure \ref{fig:cylinder_flow}. 

\subsection{Randomly packed spheres}
Through the Carman-Kozeny equation, we can theoretically predict the permeability for randomly packed spheres 
\begin{align}
	k = {a^2 \over 9K} {\phi^3 \over (1 - \phi)^2},
\end{align}
where $\phi$ is the porosity, $a$ is the sphere radius and $K$ Kozeny constant which is experimentally measured to be around five\cite{carman1937fluid}. This theoretical result has been verified to predict permeabilities in experiments, but at micrometer scale, we expect deviations.
